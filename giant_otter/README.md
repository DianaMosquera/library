# ML-Based Approach to Giant Otter Bioacoustics

## Description
A tutorial demonstrating a complete ML pipeline applied to giant otter bioacoustics, beginning with data preprocessing, proceeding to load the data, and culminating in the construction and training of a CNN-based classifier capable of labeling giant otter vocalizations according to call type.

## Data
We make use of publicly available data described in [https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0112562]. We have uploaded the data to a Google API bucket 'https://storage.googleapis.com/ml-bioacoustics-datasets/giant_otters.zip'.
