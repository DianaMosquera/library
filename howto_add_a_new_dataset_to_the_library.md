# How To Add a New Dataset to the Earth Species Library

This document outlines steps to take to add a new dataset to the Library. Datasets come in various shapes and sizes. These steps describe the most likely approach when adding a new dataset. However, some changes to the procedure may be necessary to address the intricacies of specific datasets. 


## Find a suitable dataset.

One of the aims for the ESP library is to increase access to [bioacoustic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioacoustics) datasets (predominantly audio though multimodality is encouraged) for machine learning. Many of the datasets are public domain, shared by researchers who study animals.

For example, in this [paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0112562#s5) about Giant Otter vocalizations (Mumm and Kn√∂rnschild, 2014), the authors shared audio recordings and annotations in the supplementary material. 

Annotations, which we refer to as labels, may describe vocalization type, individual speaker, behavior, or ecosystem. The Library also contains contributions from researchers directly collaborating with the Earth Species Project. 


## Download the dataset and perform exploratory analysis

Often data is entered manually by human annotators, which can be a painstaking and meticulous process. There could be misspellings or other inconsistencies that need to be corrected. 

*   How is the data organized? 
*   Do the labels follow a consistent format, or are there any issues? 
*   When you work on the preprocessed data, is it easy to load everything up?

The results of this phase should be:

*   the preprocessed dataset
*   a notebook portraying and explaining the rationale behind the steps applied to the data

## Dataset uploaded to Internet Archive

*   Package the dataset using this `zip -qr <name_of_archive>.zip annotations.csv <directory_to_include>` command.
*   upload to Internet Archive, include any relevant information as metadata, such as data license, etc

Congratulations! The next step is to submit a PR, to continue adding models and sharing your findings with the research community! Thank you for all your fantastic work!
