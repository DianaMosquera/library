* [zebra_finch](https://github.com/earthspecies/esp_library/tree/main/zebra_finch) - 3405 zebra finch calls classified across 11 call types. Additonal labels include name of individual making the vocalization and its age (chick or adult).
* [macaques](https://github.com/earthspecies/esp_library/tree/main/macaques) - 7285 macaque coo calls from 8 individuals (4 males and 4 females). There is a [collaborative tutorial](https://github.com/earthspecies/open_collaboration_on_audio_classification) of techniques to recover identity from voice.
* [giant otter](https://github.com/earthspecies/library/tree/main/giant_otter) - A tutorial demonstrating a complete ML pipeline applied to giant otter bioacoustics, beginning with data preprocessing, proceeding to load the data, and culminating in the construction and training of a CNN-based classifier capable of labeling giant otter vocalizations according to call type.
* [Egyptian fruit bats](https://github.com/earthspecies/library/tree/main/egyptian_fruit_bat)- Approximately 8k Egyptian fruit bat vocalizations classified on interaction context using fastai's pretrained resnet models.
* [dogs](https://github.com/earthspecies/library/tree/main/dogs) - 693 recordings of dog barks. 10 adult dogs, Canis familiaris, of six breeds recorded in three different situations
* [orcas](https://github.com/earthspecies/library/tree/main/orcas) - two datasets created from 30 minutes of recording by the [Orcasound Project](https://www.orcasound.net/) consisting of 398 labeled orca calls.
