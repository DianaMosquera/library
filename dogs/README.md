The [dog (Canis familiaris)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog) is a domesticated carnivore of the family [Canidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canidae). It is part of the [wolf-like canids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canina_(subtribe)), and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.

## Dataset information

This dataset consists of 693 recordings of dog barks. 10 adult dogs, Canis familiaris, of six breeds have been recorded in three different situations:

1. a disturbance situation in which a stranger rang the doorbell, 
2. an isolation situation in which the dog was locked outside or in a room isolated from its owner
3. a play situation in which either two dogs or a human and a dog played together

This dataset was collected and served as a basis for the work published in the ["Barking in domestic dogs: context specificity and individual identification"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S000334720400123X) paper by Sophia Yin and Brenda McCowan.
