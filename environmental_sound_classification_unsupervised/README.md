# envirornmental sound classification unsupervised

The ESC-US dataset is a supplementary unlabeled part of the ESC dataset consisting of
250 000 environmental recordings (5-second-long clips) suitable for unsupervised pre-training,
clustering and manifold learning experiments.

## Dataset information

The ESC dataset is a collection of short environmental recordings available in a unified format (5-second-long clips, 44.1 kHz, single channel, Ogg Vorbis compressed @ 192 kbit/s). All clips have been extracted from public field recordings available through the [Freesound.org  project](http://freesound.org/).
