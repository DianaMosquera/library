# What constitutes a machine learning ready dataset?

A machine learning dataset is one that has been preprocessed in a way that makes it amenable to being fed to machine learning models. The format we have decided to embrace
is as follows:

* recordings provided as wav files (this ensures closs platform compatibility)
* labels in `annotations.csv` file with a column referencing a file name

In particular, where possible, we want to avoid having to index into a file. Ideally, each example should be a stand alone file with a unique name. The remaning entries
in `annotations.csv` are to contain metadata or label information.
