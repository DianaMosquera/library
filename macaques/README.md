[7285 macaque coo calls](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.7f4p9) from [Distributed acoustic cues for caller identity in macaque vocalization](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4806230)

There were other interesting ways of working with the data proposed by members of the fastai v4 part 1 'Deep Learning for Coders' course cohort. You can find notebooks contributed by the students [here](https://github.com/earthspecies/macaques_open_collaboration).
